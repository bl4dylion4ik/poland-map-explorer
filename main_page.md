# MarketNav  
### Real-Estate Market Intelligence for Poland

**MarketNav is a data-driven real-estate analytics platform that turns raw listings into actionable market insights.**  
We help investors, developers, analysts, and serious buyers understand *what is really happening* in the Polish property market — in real time and over history.

This is not a listings portal.  
It is a **market intelligence system**.

## Why MarketNav Exists

Polish real-estate data is:
- Fragmented across portals
- Difficult to analyze historically
- Biased toward individual listings, not markets
- Opaque when it comes to risk, volatility, and supply pressure

Most platforms answer:
> *“What is for sale right now?”*

MarketNav answers:
> **“What is changing, where, and why — and what it means.”**
